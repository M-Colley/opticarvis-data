What would be the point of such a vehicle?

It got hung up, seemingly on loading another simulation? That's unfortunate.   Previously, I remarked my observation that I was eventually followed by a police cruiser.  This time, I was tailed by, what appeared to be an unmarked patrol car (Crown Victoria). An SUV's front wheels were spinning, when it was stopped at a red light.  My car ran a stop sign.  Lastly: I didn't like, how my automaton opted to decelerate, pretty closely to a pedestrian, as opposed to gradually slowing down.  If I were a walker, this behaviour would make me nervous.
