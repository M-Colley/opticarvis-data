I believe that is because things just were not getting any better for me. I did not understand the automated car's trajectory. Then the blue bubbles showing the coverage area were also gone for some reason. I would like to know that I am definitely in an area that the car safely understands, so when that disappeared that was unsettling.";4;"I liked many features. I would not remove anything. Having a gps that tells where the car is headed would be amazing. Seeing that the car knows it's destination and how to get there is important. Turn signals being visible would be very important to me. Even on the windsheild having an arrow in the direction the car will turn would be a great touch. The trajectory of the automated car never made sense to me so that needs some work for sure. Maybe signals or words appearing that say pedestrian detected in road or pedestrian crossing. Something that says hey there is something in front of us so we need to stop. Slowly stopping is very important. The car always took off so fast. Maybe it just looked that way to me. The turns again look unrealistic. I didn't see yeild signs but maybe I missed them. I just never fly into a roundabout like this car did in the begining every time. ";2;4;4;"I wish I could have seen the entire trip at least 2 or 3 times. Or a bit more of the trip every time. I feel it was too short to really change things dramatically enough. Maybe also asking the questions about how the person watching feels in that moment, the questions might be worded differently such as "how would you feel after that ride" (where it asks about being calm, aggitated, safe, etc.). I also feel like things would get better and so then I would focus elsewhere and trust that the parts of the trip that got better last I saw would stay better.. but if I focused elsewhere and tried to direct it to fix other things, the some of the things that got better would end up worse again. I hope that makes sense. I never felt everything was perfect but I was unsure it would get perfect especially if the trajectory was there because that threw me off every time. I got to where is was better and decent in areas to where I felt safe. Then the last trip did not feel safe. I already wrote a few things I'd love to see added in sections before this. Thank you."
