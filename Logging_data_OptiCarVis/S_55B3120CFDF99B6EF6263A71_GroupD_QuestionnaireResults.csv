Vehicle stopped slower and at a better distance from crosswalks. Turns were take  at a much better way and not so suddenly. The stop sign was not stopped at close to the end. And towards the ends on person looked to be approaching to cross the street and the vehicle never slowed to check but for the most part a much better ride today.

I liked the wind blowing in the trees. I know that was random. I didn't notice if the vehicle ran the stop sign today or not. Vehicle stopped closer to the crosswalks today than yesterday so that caused a bit of anxiety and the vehicle went a tad bit faster but not too bad.
