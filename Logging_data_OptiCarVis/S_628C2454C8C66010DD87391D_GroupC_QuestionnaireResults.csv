What all is going on makes sense at times, but can feel distracting and overly much. Do I need all this info? Would it make sense to reduce the visuals to only the most crucial aspects?"

It doesn't make sense that it would go from light blue, to dark blue, when in fact there needs to be MORE attention that they are crossing. Yellow is fair, as it signifies warning, but red signifies stopping and catches the drivers attention more when it's needed."
