There was a typo though earlier in one of the questions. I think the word was description. Anyway, the vehicle seemed to drive a little too fast and was stopping a little too suddenly. It reminded me of those jumpy drivers who are constantly moving but changing speed at the same time by slowing down, speeding up, and so on. I didn't like the driving but it was safe at least."

But for some reason not having any symbols on them made me feel safer and trust the vehicle. Everything worked smoothly by the way."

I will admit that I felt a little more anxious than in the others. I also feel that the car makes turns suddenly without much warning. I don't like that but I also understand why it makes those turns and decisions."
