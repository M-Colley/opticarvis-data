The automatic vehicles being able to gauge what pedestrians are doing (staying on sidewalk, crossing, etc.) is one thing, but there are other variables. People having dogs next to them, people facing the road, etc. are all factors that I didn't notice in this version of the design. Maybe in future ratings these could be tested as well since it is very common. Another example would be if a pedestrian is walking in the side of the road near the sidewalk, but not on the sidewalk - what would the AV do in that scenario? What about a human on a bike in the road, or skateboard?";6;"I included some opinions on the design above. To elaborate more, I wonder if there could be warning symbols and sounds when cars are braking, humans are near the road/facing the road, cars get too close to the back or sides of the automatic vehicle, and other examples I could name. I also thought about the highlighting used for pedestrians and cars which was red for pedestrians and blue for vehicles. I think a bright green could be a good color to use to emphasize the importance of safety (green is usually associated with safe, red with danger). Furthermore maybe the AV should come to a total stop if it sees a pedestrian about to cross/in the process of crossing, or have audio warnings that play out of speakers to pedestrians. Pedestrians may not always be aware it is an AV and act differently because human drivers are not binary like computers, and human drivers can understand when a pedestrian is facing the road and considering crossing while an AV might not.";4;4;5;"I actually explained my design ideas in detail on the previous page. Thank you."
