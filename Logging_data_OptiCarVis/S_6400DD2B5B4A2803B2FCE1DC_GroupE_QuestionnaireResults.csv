It is jarring when it turns suddenly, because you don't trust that it has checked for pedestrians before it makes the turn (especially if you can't see left or right like in this simulation).

I dislike things being highlighted"" like humans and cars, though the occluded blue cars can be nice especially if they are fully behind buildings. I don't like the trajectory lines in front of the cars, as it changes rapidly and doesn't seem useful at all. The blue spheres can be distracting but they weren't bad this time because they were light blue. When they are solid blue it is bad. I would like some anticipation when it comes to turns, like a turn signal or an anticipated trajectory on the street, sort of like a gps system would have but on the road in front of you. """
