## Abstract
Automated vehicle (AV) acceptance relies on user understanding via feedback visualizations. Traditional "one-size-fits-all" designs are often suboptimal and resource-intensive. This study introduces OptiCarVis, a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for personalizing AV feedback visualizations. By leveraging subjective user feedback and computational optimization, OptiCarVis significantly improved perceived safety, trust, predictability, and acceptance while reducing cognitive load in a study with 117 participants. This dataset supports further research into personalized optimization for automotive UI design.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes:
- Responses to trust, safety, cognitive load, predictability, and aesthetics metrics
- Design parameters for each optimization iteration
- Comparisons between cold-start, warm-start, and traditional design methods
- Expert-generated standard design parameters

We also provide the R-scripts for the evaluation of the data.
