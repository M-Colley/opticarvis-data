The trajectory of other vehicles was different to see even at maximum visibility. My anticipated trajectory was a little unclear to me. I would like more obvious directionality disaplayed in the HUD. I think a trial at a slower pace would help me evaluate more before going straight to a real life simulation. It was a little overwhelming to start at that speed. Overall, I did like the amount of information displayed and I think with time it would be very satisfying."

Not sure if that was intentional. Also the vehicle stopped at one point and I wasn't sure why. I think I would like if it displayed the reason for stopping, such a stop sign or red light displayed somewhere if that is the reason."
