The blue color for pedestrians wasn't as easy to recognize as something more alerting such as red/orange for crossing pedestrians."

The indicators above people walking also don't feel intuitive. Something more alerting when the AI predicts a person might cross into the street like an exclaimation in yellow. I'm also trying to imagine this in real life, would people need to be shaded blue? Maybe on a radar or display screen of some sort, though even something like green lines that show the way the camera picks up and detects a persons movements (green lines for their arms/legs/body/head) in my opinion would be more useful than shading a person blue or red."
