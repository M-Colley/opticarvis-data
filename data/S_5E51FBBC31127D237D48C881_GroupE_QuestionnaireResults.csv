I couldn't pay attention to everything at the same time because things seemed to go so quickly. I think going through a tutorial where you are shown with videos would make things easier to understand and prepare the viewer for the program much better than the small photos that did not show everything perfectly clearly.

The car knew the person was going to cross the street but did not slow down until it was close to hitting the person.

The turn right at the begining is scary as well because it is too small to be realistic.

The turns are so small and the road size and turns seem to small to be realistic. Also the car just flies into the roundabout without seeming to yeild which is frightening.

The red/pink shows where the car intends on going. It is not very clear.

It is hard to tell what the car is going to do next. It never says its going to take a right turn into the roundabout, it actually looks like it will go the opposite direction.

The blue was supposed to be aimed in a direction that was confident. The pink/red was supposed to be in a less confident direction. The blue is aimed in directions that do not always make sense and the pink is usually going in a way that makes a bit more sense, at least somewhat staying in a lane.

I just wish it was more clear. Maybe with a map of the area on the dashboard like a gps system that normal cars have. Just so you know where you are going beforehand.

The automated car's trajectory just confuses me. Acceleration after stopping is too fast. The roundabout turn feels rigid and uncomfortable.

I was not looking at first to be honest but by the time I noticed they were gone, I felt lost and it looked like I was on the wrong side of the road at that point. I know the car did not stop at a stop sign toward the end of the trip. I wish I could see a turn signal at any point to know which direction I was going to be headed. It was a bit more frightening than any other ride.
